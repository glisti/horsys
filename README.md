The Horsys project is designed to solve non-standard practice of record keeping at the Peach Creek Equestrian Center.  
This is an application that allows the barn managers remotely view and modify the information that is needed for each horse.
The Horsys project has taken all of the necessary records, updates, and schedules and put them into an online system where they are easily accessible, and available from outside of the barn.  
The online application has time sheets for clocking in, horse records, a feeding calendar, feeding information, and what each horse gets morning and night.   
Lastly, any critical changes or updates made in the Horsys system are be sent out via email notification.   
This project fits perfectly in the domain of Computer Engineering by designing an online database system.
